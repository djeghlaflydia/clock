# Make a Clock Using Python

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to create a simple digital clock using Python's `tkinter` library. The clock displays the current time and updates every second. This is a great project to learn graphical user interface (GUI) programming in Python and how to use the `tkinter` library for creating desktop applications.

### How It Works
1. **Import Libraries**: The script starts by importing the necessary libraries - `tkinter` for the GUI and `strftime` from the `time` module for formatting the time.
2. **Initialize Tkinter**: The `Tk` class from `tkinter` is used to create the main window of the application.
3. **Define the `time` Function**: A function named `time` is defined to get the current time, format it, and update the label widget every second.
4. **Create Label Widget**: A `Label` widget is created to display the time, with specific font, background, and foreground colors.
5. **Start the Clock**: The `time` function is called to start the clock and the `mainloop` method is used to run the application.

To run this project, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, install the tkinter library if it's not already installed.

This simple project showcases how to use the tkinter library in Python to create a basic digital clock. By completing this project, you gain a better understanding of GUI programming in Python and how to update GUI elements dynamically. Feel free to experiment with different styles and functionalities to enhance this clock application.
